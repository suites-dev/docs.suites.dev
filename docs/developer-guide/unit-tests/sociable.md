# Sociable Unit Tests

## Introduction

Sociable unit tests focus on testing a component with its real dependencies while still controlling the dependencies of those dependencies. This approach ensures that you verify how components actually interact in a controlled environment, providing more realistic validation than solitary tests.

:::note When to use sociable tests
Sociable tests are ideal when:
- You need to verify interactions between components
- You want to test integration points between several components
- You're testing behaviors that emerge from component collaboration
- You want to refactor internal implementation without breaking tests
:::

In contrast to [solitary unit tests](/docs/developer-guide/unit-tests/solitary), which replace all dependencies with mocks, sociable tests use real implementations for selected dependencies to verify genuine interactions.

## Step-by-Step Example

Continuing from our previous example with the `UserService` class, we'll now set up a sociable unit test. We'll use a real `UserApi` dependency while still mocking its dependencies (`HttpService`) and other dependencies of `UserService` (`Database`).

> ðŸ’¡ This example is agnostic to the mocking library (we'll use Jest) and any specific DI framework's adapter.

### Step 1: Define the Classes

Here are the interfaces and classes we'll use in our example:

```typescript title="types.ts"
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

export interface IncomingEvent {
  type: string;
  data: unknown;
}
```

```typescript title="services.ts"
import { User } from './types';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService {
  async get(url: string): Promise<unknown> { /* Make HTTP request */ }
}

@Injectable()
export class UserApi {
  constructor(private http: HttpService) {}

  async getRandom(): Promise<User> {
    const response = await this.http.get('/random-user');
    return response.data;
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class Database {
  async saveUser(user: User): Promise<number> { /* Save user to the database */ }
}
```

```typescript title="user.service.ts"
import { User, Database } from './services';
import { UserApi } from './user-api';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private userApi: UserApi, private database: Database) {}

  async generateRandomUser(): Promise<number | boolean> {
    try {
      const user = await this.userApi.getRandom();
      return this.database.saveUser(user);
    } catch (error) {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Test

To test the `UserService` class with a real `UserApi` dependency, we'll use the `TestBed.sociable()` method and specify which dependencies should be real using the `.expose()` method:

```typescript title="user.service.spec.ts" {1,10-12,16,21-23} showLineNumbers
import { TestBed, Mocked } from '@suites/unit';
import { UserService } from './user.service';
import { UserApi, HttpService, Database } from './services';
import { User } from './types';

describe('UserService Integration Tests', () => {
  let userService: UserService;

  // Note: userApi is NOT Mocked since it will be a real instance
  let database: Mocked<Database>; // A mock with stubbed methods
  let httpService: Mocked<HttpService>; // A mock with stubbed methods

  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Create the test environment with UserApi as a real dependency
    const { unit, unitRef } = await TestBed.sociable(UserService)
      .expose(UserApi) // UserApi will be a real implementation
      .compile();

    userService = unit;

    // Retrieve the mock instances (note: you can't retrieve UserApi)
    database = unitRef.get(Database);
    httpService = unitRef.get(HttpService);
  });

  it('should generate a random user and save to the database', async () => {
    // Configure the stubbed methods of the mocked dependencies
    const userFixture: User = { id: 1, name: 'John' };
    httpService.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: userFixture });
    database.saveUser.mockResolvedValue(42);

    // Test the behavior that emerges from the real interaction between UserService and UserApi
    const result = await userService.generateRandomUser();
    
    // Verify the result is what we expect
    expect(result).toBe(42);
  });
});
```

### Understanding `.expose()` Behavior

In sociable tests, the `.expose()` method indicates which classes should be real implementations rather than mocks:

1. **Real Implementations**: Classes specified in `.expose()` are instantiated as real objects
2. **Mocked Dependencies**: The dependencies of exposed classes are still automatically mocked (each method becomes a stub)
3. **Cannot Retrieve Exposed Classes**: Exposed classes can't be retrieved from `unitRef.get()` because they are real implementations, not mocks

### Important Considerations When Using Sociable Tests

When using sociable tests, keep the following points in mind:

**1. Focus on Outcomes, Not Implementations**

Even though sociable tests let you test real interactions, they should still focus on testing the outcomes (return values, state changes) rather than implementation details.

**2. Avoid Excessive Exposure**

Don't expose too many classes in a single test. The more classes you expose, the closer your test gets to being an integration test, potentially making it slower and more brittle.

**3. Complementary to Solitary Tests**

Sociable tests complement solitary tests - they don't replace them. Use solitary tests for detailed behavior verification and sociable tests for validating interactions.

### Step 3: Configuring Mock Behavior

Like with solitary tests, you can use `.mock().final()` and `.mock().impl()` to configure the behavior of stubbed methods in your mocks for non-exposed dependencies:

```typescript
beforeAll(async () => {
  const { unit, unitRef } = await TestBed.sociable(UserService)
    .expose(UserApi) // UserApi will be a real implementation
    .mock(Database) // Specify which dependency to configure
    .final({
      // Define each method's behavior
      saveUser: async () => 42
    })
    .compile();

  userService = unit;
  httpService = unitRef.get(HttpService);
});
```

## What's Next?

By combining solitary and sociable unit tests, you can create a comprehensive testing strategy that validates both independent component behavior and component interactions. This balanced approach provides confidence in your system while maintaining test maintainability.
