title: Distinguishing Between Unit and Integration
---


## When to Prefer the Solitary Approach?

Choosing the right testing approach depends on various factors, including the nature of the unit under test and the
complexity of its interactions. The solitary approach is particularly well-suited for:

- **"Final" Classes**: Classes designed to stand alone or contain self-sufficient logic often benefit from solitary
  testing. This isolation allows for a focused evaluation of their behavior without external interference.
- **Classes with Minimal Dependencies**: Units that interact with one or two dependencies, especially those implementing
  well-defined interfaces, are prime candidates for solitary testing. This setup simplifies the mocking process and
  keeps the tests manageable and focused.
- **Specific Behavior Testing**: For units encapsulating specific, critical logic (e.g., algorithmic functions or core
  business rules), solitary testing ensures that these behaviors are thoroughly validated in isolation from
  unpredictable external factors.

Incorporating these considerations into your testing strategy enhances the effectiveness of your tests and ensures they
provide meaningful feedback on your code's design and functionality.
