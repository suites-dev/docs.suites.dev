description: Learn how to install and configure Suites to enhance your unit testing process across various DI frameworks and testing libraries.

Suites is compatible with a wide range of testing and dependency injection frameworks. This section provides
instructions for installing Suites and highlights important compatibility and configuration details.

## Setup Suites in a New or Existing Project


First, install Suites' core package:

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/unit
```

Then, to fully integrate Suites into your mocking and dependency injection frameworks, install the corresponding
adapters for your project. For example, to use Suites with Jest and NestJS you would run (alongside the core package):

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/doubles.jest @suites/di.nestjs
````

Suites will automatically detect the installed adapters and configure itself accordingly.

### Supported Testing Libraries and DI Frameworks (Adapters)
* **Available DI Adapters:**
  * `@suites/di.nestjs`
  * `@suites/di.inversify`
  * _`@suites/di.tsyringe`_ (WIP)

* **Available Mocking Libraries:**
  * `@suites/doubles.jest`
  * `@suites/doubles.sinon`
  * `@suites/doubles.vitest`
  * _`@suites/doubles.bun`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.deno`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.node`_ Vanilla (WIP)

After installation, no additional configuration for the test runner is needed.

### Setting Up `tsconfig.json`
In order to use Suites, you need to enable the [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata) and [`experimentalDecorators`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators) options in your `tsconfig.json` file.
This configuration is necessary for Suites to reflect class dependencies and to work with dependency injection frameworks.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

### For Vitest Users

When integrating Suites with Vitest, additional configuration is required. Vitest typically uses [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) for
TypeScript interpretation, which doesn't support `emitDecoratorMetadata` - a feature extensively used by Suites for
reflecting class dependencies. To overcome this, switch to using [`@swc/core`](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/core) via a
plugin, which supports `emitDecoratorMetadata`. For detailed guidance, see the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/).

Here is an example of how to configure Suites with Vitest:

First, install the `unplugin-swc` and `@swc/core` packages and add it to your `vitest.config.ts` file as a plugin.
This will enable `@swc/core` to interpret TypeScript files and support `emitDecoratorMetadata`.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev unplugin-swc @swc/core
```

```typescript title="vitest.config.ts"
import swc from 'unplugin-swc';
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    root: './',
  },
  plugins: [
    // This is required to build the test files with SWC
    swc.vite({
      // Explicitly set the module type to avoid inheriting this value from a `.swcrc` config file
      module: { type: 'es6' },
    }),
  ],
});

```

## Monorepo Support

Suites is fully compatible with Monorepo, accommodating projects that use different DI frameworks. Ensure you
install the correct adapter for each workspace within your Monorepo. In some cases, multiple adapters may be necessary
to support different frameworks within your project.

After installing Suites, you can start writing your first test.
