## What is a Meta-Framework?

A meta-framework is essentially a framework of frameworks. Unlike traditional frameworks that provide a specific set of
functionalities and tools directly to the end-user, a meta-framework operates at a higher level. It integrates,
orchestrates, and enhances underlying frameworks, libraries, and tools without being a direct provider of the
functionality itself. The primary goal of a meta-framework is to unify disparate technologies under a single, cohesive
interface, streamlining processes and improving efficiency for developers.

## What is a Testing Meta-Framework?

It's a meta-framework specifically for the domain of software testing. Rather than replacing existing testing tools such
as test runners, mocking libraries, or assertion libraries, a testing meta-framework integrates and enhances these
components.

It abstracts the complexities involved in setting up and configuring multiple testing tools, providing a
unified interface that simplifies their use. This not only streamlines the testing process but also ensures that
developers can focus more on writing effective tests and less on managing the tools themselves.

By harmonizing different
testing methodologies and tools, a testing meta-framework facilitates a more efficient, cohesive approach to software
testing, adaptable to various testing needs and environments.
