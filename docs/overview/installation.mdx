## Setup Suites in a New or Existing Project

This section provides instructions for installing Suites and highlights important compatibility and configuration
details.

First, install Suites' main package:

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/unit
```

Then, to fully integrate Suites into your mocking and dependency injection frameworks, install the corresponding
di framework and mocking library adapters for your project.

For example, to use Suites with Jest and NestJS you would run (alongside `@suites/unit` core package):

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/doubles.jest @suites/di.nestjs
````

Lastly, make sure `reflect-metadata` is also installed in your project, not as a dev dependency ([Why?](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#metadata)):

```bash
$ npm i reflect-metadata
````

Suites will automatically detect the installed adapters and configure itself accordingly.

## Supported Libraries
### Available Dependency Injection Adapters:
  * `@suites/di.nestjs`
  * `@suites/di.inversify`
  * _`@suites/di.tsyringe`_ (WIP)

### Available Mocking Libraries Adapters:
  * `@suites/doubles.jest`
  * `@suites/doubles.sinon`
  * `@suites/doubles.vitest`
  * _`@suites/doubles.bun`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.deno`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.node`_ Vanilla (WIP)

After installation, no additional configuration for the test runner is needed.

## Setting Up `tsconfig.json`
In order to use Suites, you need to enable the [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata) and [`experimentalDecorators`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators) options in your `tsconfig.json` file.
This configuration is necessary for Suites to reflect class dependencies and to work with dependency injection frameworks.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## For Yarn v1.x Users

Due to a known issue with Yarn `v1.x`'s `postinstall` script handling
([see details](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5476)), an extra step is required to set up reference types for
your project when using Suites.

Follow these instructions to manually add the necessary type references:

1. **Create a `global.d.ts` file**: Place this file in your project's `rootDir` (as specified in your `tsconfig.json`).

2. **Add the reference type**: Inside `global.d.ts`, include the reference type for your chosen mocking library:

```typescript title="global.d.ts"
/// <reference types="@suites/doubles.<YOUR_MOCKING_LIBRARY>/unit" />
   ```

3. **Example**: If youâ€™re using Jest, the content of the `global.d.ts` should be:

```typescript title="global.d.ts"
/// <reference types="@suites/doubles.jest/unit" />
   ```

By adding this reference manually, you ensure that your project correctly recognizes the types from the Suites
framework, allowing for a smooth development experience.

## Monorepo Support

Suites is fully compatible with Monorepo, accommodating projects that use different mocking or di frameworks.

### Recommended Setups (for Monorepo / Non-Monorepo)

If you are using Suites in a Monorepo, consider the following setups:

**Using one the same mocking and di framework across all workspaces** \
Install the corresponding adapter under the root directory of your Monorepo.
Suites will automatically detect the adapter and configure itself accordingly.

**Using different frameworks across workspaces** \
Install the corresponding adapter in each workspace separately. Make sure to config the hoisting of the `node_modules`
to enable Suites to detect the adapter in the workspace.

:::note
Unfortunately, NPM workspaces do not support the hoisting of dependencies, which means that working with different DI or
mocking libraries with npm workspaces is not supported at the moment. We recommend using Yarn workspaces for this purpose.

## For Vitest Users

When integrating Suites with Vitest, additional configuration is required. Vitest typically uses [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) for
TypeScript interpretation, which doesn't support `emitDecoratorMetadata` - a feature extensively used by Suites for
reflecting class dependencies. To overcome this, switch to using [`@swc/core`](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/core) via a
plugin, which supports `emitDecoratorMetadata`. For detailed guidance, see the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/).

Here is an example of how to configure Suites with Vitest:

First, install the `unplugin-swc` and `@swc/core` packages and add it to your `vitest.config.ts` file as a plugin.
This will enable `@swc/core` to interpret TypeScript files and support `emitDecoratorMetadata`.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev unplugin-swc @swc/core
```

```typescript title="vitest.config.ts"
import swc from 'unplugin-swc';
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: { globals: true, root: './' },
  plugins: [
    swc.vite({ module: { type: 'es6' } }),
  ],
});

```
