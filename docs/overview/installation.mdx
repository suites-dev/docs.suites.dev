## Setup Suites in a New or Existing Project

This section provides instructions for installing Suites and highlights important compatibility and configuration
details for setting up unit testing with your DI framework.

:::info
:bulb: You can find complete setup examples in the [Suites Examples](https://github.com/suites-dev/examples) repository
:::

### Step 1: Install Core Package

First, install Suites' main package:

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/unit
```

### Step 2: Install Adapters

To integrate Suites with your dependency injection framework and preferred testing library, install the corresponding
adapters for your project.

For example, to use Suites with Jest and NestJS you would run (alongside `@suites/unit` core package):

```bash
$ npm i -D @suites/doubles.jest @suites/di.nestjs
```

### Step 3: Install reflect-metadata

Make sure `reflect-metadata` is also installed in your project, not as a dev dependency ([Why?](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#metadata)):

```bash
$ npm i reflect-metadata
```

Suites will automatically detect the installed adapters and configure itself accordingly.

## Required: Type Reference Configuration

:::warning This step is REQUIRED for the `Mocked<T>` type to work
Without this configuration, you will encounter TypeScript errors like "Cannot find name 'Mocked'" or "Type 'Mocked' is not generic". This is the most common setup issue with Suites.
:::

To ensure type safety and enable the `Mocked<T>` type, you **must** set up type references for your mocking library:

### Setting Up Type References

1. **Create a `global.d.ts` file** in your project's root directory (or the location specified as `rootDir` in your `tsconfig.json`).

2. **Add the reference type** for your chosen mocking library:

```typescript title="global.d.ts"
/// <reference types="@suites/doubles.jest/unit" />  // For Jest
// OR
/// <reference types="@suites/doubles.sinon/unit" /> // For Sinon
// OR
/// <reference types="@suites/doubles.vitest/unit" /> // For Vitest
```

3. **Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes this file**:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.spec.ts",
    "global.d.ts"  // Make sure this is included
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures your project correctly recognizes the types provided by Suites (like the `Mocked<T>` type) without needing to import them from library-specific modules.

:::tip Troubleshooting
If you're still getting "Cannot find name 'Mocked'" errors after adding the type reference:
- Restart your TypeScript language server (in VSCode: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server")
- Make sure the `global.d.ts` file is in your project root or included in your `tsconfig.json`
- Verify you've installed the correct adapter package (e.g., `@suites/doubles.jest` for Jest)
:::

## Setting Up `tsconfig.json`

In addition to the type references, you need to enable decorator support in your `tsconfig.json` file.
This configuration is necessary for Suites to reflect class dependencies and to work with dependency injection frameworks.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    // ... other options
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.spec.ts",
    "global.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

## Supported Libraries
### Available Dependency Injection Adapters:
  * `@suites/di.nestjs`
  * `@suites/di.inversify`
  * _`@suites/di.tsyringe`_ (WIP)

### Available Mocking Libraries Adapters:
  * `@suites/doubles.jest`
  * `@suites/doubles.sinon`
  * `@suites/doubles.vitest`
  * _`@suites/doubles.bun`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.deno`_ (WIP)
  * _`@suites/doubles.node`_ Vanilla (WIP)

After installation and configuration, no additional setup for the test runner is needed.

## Monorepo Support

Suites is fully compatible with monorepo setups, accommodating projects that use different mocking or DI frameworks.

### Recommended Setups

When using Suites in a monorepo, consider the following setups:

**Using the same mocking and DI framework across all workspaces** \
Install the corresponding adapter under the root directory of your monorepo.
Suites will automatically detect the adapter and configure itself accordingly.

**Using different frameworks across workspaces** \
Install the corresponding adapter in each workspace separately. Make sure to configure your package manager's hoisting settings
to enable Suites to detect the adapter in each workspace.

:::note
Some package managers may have limitations with dependency hoisting that can affect using different DI or mocking libraries
across workspaces. Please refer to your package manager's documentation for specific guidance on dependency hoisting.
:::

## For Vitest Users

When integrating Suites with Vitest, additional configuration is required. Vitest typically uses [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) for
TypeScript interpretation, which doesn't support `emitDecoratorMetadata` - a feature extensively used by Suites for
reflecting class dependencies. To overcome this, switch to using [`@swc/core`](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/core) via a
plugin, which supports `emitDecoratorMetadata`. For detailed guidance, see the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/).

Here is an example of how to configure Suites with Vitest:

First, install the `unplugin-swc` and `@swc/core` packages and add it to your `vitest.config.ts` file as a plugin.
This will enable `@swc/core` to interpret TypeScript files and support `emitDecoratorMetadata`.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev unplugin-swc @swc/core
```

```typescript title="vitest.config.ts"
import swc from 'unplugin-swc';
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: { globals: true, root: './' },
  plugins: [
    swc.vite({ module: { type: 'es6' } }),
  ],
});
```
