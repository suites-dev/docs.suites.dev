# The Shift from Automock to Suites

## Introduction

As technology and development practices evolve, so too must the tools that support them. Automock has been at the
forefront of simplifying unit testing by providing a streamlined approach to creating mocks and stubs within various
dependency injection frameworks. Building on the strong foundation laid by Automock, we are excited to introduce its
successor: Suites. This evolution marks a significant milestone in our journey to enhance and expand the capabilities of
our testing tools to better meet the needs of modern software development.

## Why Suites?

Suites represents a natural progression from Automock, aiming to address new challenges and leverage advancements in
software testing practices. The transition to Suites is driven by several key factors:

### Broader Scope

While Automock was primarily focused on mocking within DI frameworks, Suites expands this scope to encompass a more
comprehensive range of testing functionalities. This includes a unified approach to handling test doubles, integration
with multiple testing frameworks, and support for both synchronous and asynchronous testing environments.

### Enhanced Flexibility

Suites introduces a more flexible architecture that is adaptable to various testing scenarios and environments. By
abstracting away the complexities of integrating with different DI frameworks and mocking libraries, Suites provides a
more robust and adaptable platform that can grow with your project's needs.

### Improved Developer Experience

At the heart of Suites is the goal to improve the developer experience. By consolidating functionality into a cohesive
framework and reducing the boilerplate associated with setting up tests, Suites enables developers to focus more on
writing meaningful tests and less on configuring their testing tools.

## Transitioning from Automock to Suites

The shift from Automock to Suites is not just a change of tools but a step towards a more integrated and efficient
approach to software testing. Suites is committed to retaining all the strengths of Automock while opening new avenues
for testing capabilities.

For existing Automock users, transitioning to Suites has been made as smooth as possible. We have developed
comprehensive migration tools and documentation to ensure that your move to Suites is straightforward and beneficial.
