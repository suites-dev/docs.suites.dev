**Suites is an opinionated, flexible testing meta-framework aim at elevating the software testing experience within
backend systems.**

By integrating a wide array of testing tools into a cohesive framework, Suites simplifies the process
of creating reliable tests, thereby ensuring the development of high-quality software.
[Originating from the solid foundation laid by Automock](/docs/overview/migrating-from-automock/), Suites has evolved into a more comprehensive solution,
aimed at addressing [a broader range of testing challenges](/docs/overview/problems-solved/).


## Supported Libraries

Suites supports a broad spectrum of DI frameworks and testing libraries including:

✅ **Dependency Injection Frameworks:** NestJS, InversifyJS (TSyringe coming soon!) \
✅ **Mocking Libraries:** Jest, Sinon, and Vitest (Bun and Deno coming soon!)

## Suites as a Meta-Framework

Suites is a meta-framework that integrates various testing libraries and tools, such as Jest, Sinon, and Vitest, with
dependency injection frameworks like NestJS and InversifyJS. By combining these technologies, Suites provides a
comprehensive testing solution that simplifies the process of writing, running, and managing tests for backend systems.

## What is a Meta-Framework?

A meta-framework is essentially a framework of frameworks. Unlike traditional frameworks that provide a specific set of
functionalities and tools directly to the end-user, a meta-framework operates at a higher level. It integrates,
orchestrates, and enhances underlying frameworks, libraries, and tools without being a direct provider of the
functionality itself.

## Prerequisites

  - Familiarity with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - Familiarity with [basic testing principles and practices](/docs)
  - You use a dependency injection framework

## What's Next?

Now that you have a basic understanding of what Suites is, you can explore the features and capabilities it
offers.

To get started, check out the [Quick Start](/docs/overview/quickstart) guide to learn how to set up Suites in
your project and start writing tests.
