# Welcome to Suites!

Suites is an opinionated, flexible [testing meta-framework](/docs/overview/what-is-suites#suites-as-a-meta-framework)
aimed at elevating the software testing experience within backend systems working with dependency injection (DI)
frameworks. \
It provides a unified testing experience that combines best practices, industry standards, and a wide range
of testing tools to help developers create robust, maintainable, and scalable test suites, thereby ensuring the
development of high-quality software.

### Fluent and Convenient API

Suites offers a fluent, convenient, and semantic API that makes writing tests a pleasure. The intuitive design of the
API ensures that you can quickly set up your tests and focus on verifying the behavior of your application.

```typescript title="user.service.spec.ts"
import { TestBed, Mocked } from '@suites/unit';

describe('User Service Unit Spec', () => {
  let underTest: UserService;
  let userApi: Mocked<UserApi>;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const { unit, unitRef } = await TestBed.solitary(UserService).compile();

    underTest = unit;

    userApi = unitRef.get(UserApi);
  });

  it('should generate a random user and save to the database', async () => {
    userApi.getRandom.mockResolvedValue({ id: 1, name: 'John' } as User);
    await underTest.generateRandomUser();
    expect(database.saveUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith(userFixture);
  });
});
```
