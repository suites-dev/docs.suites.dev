# Welcome to Suites!

Suites is an opinionated, flexible [testing meta-framework](https://google.com) aimed at elevating the software testing experience within
backend systems. By integrating a wide array of testing tools into a cohesive framework, Suites simplifies the process
of creating reliable tests, thereby ensuring the development of high-quality software.

### Fluent and Convenient API

Suites offers a fluent, convenient, and semantic API that makes writing tests a pleasure. The intuitive design of the
API ensures that you can quickly set up your tests and focus on verifying the behavior of your application.

```typescript title="user.service.spec.ts"
import { TestBed, Mocked } from '@suites/unit';

describe('User Service Unit Spec', () => {
  let underTest: UserService;
  let userApi: Mocked<UserApi>;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const { unit, unitRef } = await TestBed.solitary(UserService).compile();

    underTest = unit;

    userApi = unitRef.get(UserApi);
  });

  it('should generate a random user and save to the database', async () => {
    userApi.getRandom.mockResolvedValue({ id: 1, name: 'John' } as User);
    await underTest.generateRandomUser();
    expect(database.saveUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith(userFixture);
  });
});
```

### Solving Key Challenges

- 👨‍💻👩‍💻 **Inconsistent Testing Practices**: Suites promotes a standardized approach to testing, incorporating industry
best practices and methodologies to ensure a high level of consistency and quality in test suites.

- 📉 **Learning Curve for New Testing Tools**: Suites mitigates this by offering comprehensive learning resources and
guides, reducing the learning curve for new tools and practices, and keeping developers up-to-date with the latest in
testing methodologies.

- 😥 **Time-Consuming Test Setup and Configuration**: Suites provides templates and pre-configured setups to accelerate
this process, allowing developers to focus more on writing tests and less on setup.

- 🧪 **Difficulty in Scaling Testing Efforts**: Suites' flexible architecture supports projects of all sizes, from small
microservices to large monoliths, ensuring that testing practices can scale alongside project development.

- 🔍 **Fragmented Testing Ecosystem**: Suites acts as a central hub for testing, guiding users in selecting the right
tools and methodologies for their specific needs, and providing a comprehensive solution that covers unit testing (and
also integration testing in the near future).

## Emphasizing Community and Official Support

Suites is officially documented and supported within the NestJS and InversifyJS communities, with more DI adapters to
come. This official support ensures that you have access to the latest features, best practices, and community-driven
enhancements.
